# Project Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium Pro

### The application should display

- [x] A list of cats by name
- [x] An area to display the selected cat
- [ ] An admin button
- [ ] An admin area with inputs for changing the cat's name, url, and number of clicks (hidden by default).

### In the cat display area, the following should be displayed

- [x] The cat's name
- [x] A picture of the cat
- [x] Text showing the number of clicks
- [x] The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

## Interaction

- [x]  When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
- [x]  The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
- [ ]  When the admin button is clicked, the admin area should appear with the inputs filled in for the currently-selected cat.
- [ ]  When the cancel button in the admin area is pressed, the admin area disappears.
- [ ]  When the save button in the admin area is pressed, the currently-selected cat's values update with the values in the admin area, and the admin area disappears.
